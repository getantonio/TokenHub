# V6 Factory Distribution Fix

## Problem Overview

The previous factory implementations (V4 and V5) had issues with token distribution. When creating tokens with custom distribution allocations, the tokens remained in the factory's balance instead of being transferred to the designated wallets. This was due to a sequence issue in the token creation and module initialization process.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Ownership Transfer Timing**: The token ownership was transferred to the security module before the distribution was completed, which prevented proper token transfers.

2. **Module Structure**: The distribution module was not properly integrated with the token, causing `getModules()` to return an empty array.

3. **Token Transfer Permissions**: After ownership transfer, the factory lost permissions to transfer tokens.

## Solution Details

The `V4FactoryWithLiquidityFixedV6` contract implements these key fixes:

1. **Direct Token Distribution**: The factory now transfers tokens directly to non-vested wallet allocations before transferring token ownership.

2. **Improved Module Handling**: Modules are now properly registered and initialized in the correct sequence.

3. **Optimized Transfer Sequence**:
   - Create and initialize token with factory as owner
   - Create all required modules
   - Add modules to the token
   - Distribute tokens to recipients
   - Transfer ownership to security module 

4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added deployment info events to track the process for easier troubleshooting.

## Technical Implementation

The key change is in the `_createTokenWithDistribution` function, which now:

1. Creates the token with the factory as the initial owner
2. Creates and adds all required modules in the correct order
3. Processes non-vested allocations by transferring tokens directly from the factory
4. For vested allocations, transfers tokens to the distribution module
5. Only transfers ownership to the security module after all tokens are distributed

## Deployment Information

The V6 fixed factory has been deployed to:

- Polygon Amoy: `0xe175397FA8D3494Ad5986cb2A2C5622AD473fB3B`

## Testing Confirmation

Testing has confirmed that:

1. Tokens are properly distributed to all designated wallets
2. The factory balance is 0 after token creation
3. All allocation percentages are correctly respected
4. Module structure is maintained properly

## Implementation for Developers

To use the V6 factory in your TokenForm, update your code to prioritize the V6 factory address:

```typescript
// Determine if we're using custom distribution
const useCustomDistribution = (data.wallets && data.wallets.length > 0);

if (useCustomDistribution) {
  // First try V6 factory (best option)
  factoryAddress = getNetworkContractAddress(chainIdNumber, "FACTORY_ADDRESS_V4_WITH_LIQUIDITY_FIXED_V6");
  
  // Fall back to older versions if needed
  if (!factoryAddress || factoryAddress === "") {
    factoryAddress = getNetworkContractAddress(chainIdNumber, "FACTORY_ADDRESS_V4_WITH_LIQUIDITY_FIXED_V5");
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

The V6 factory fixes the token distribution issues, ensuring tokens are properly allocated to designated wallets upon creation. This implementation maintains all the functionality of the previous factory versions while resolving the distribution problems.
