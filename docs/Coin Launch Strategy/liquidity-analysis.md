# Token Liquidity and Investment Tiers Analysis

## Understanding Liquidity

### What is Liquidity?
Liquidity in token markets represents the ease with which a token can be bought or sold without causing significant price impact. It's primarily determined by:
- The amount of tokens available for trading
- The amount of paired currency (usually ETH, BNB, USDT, etc.)
- The depth of the order book or liquidity pool
- The distribution of tokens across different price levels

### Key Liquidity Metrics
1. Market Depth
   - Measures how much trading volume is needed to move price by 1%
   - Higher depth = more stable price action
   - Lower depth = higher volatility

2. Bid-Ask Spread
   - Difference between highest buy and lowest sell orders
   - Tighter spread = more efficient market
   - Wider spread = higher trading costs

3. Slippage
   - Price impact from executing larger orders
   - Lower slippage = better liquidity
   - Higher slippage = poor liquidity

### Liquidity Requirements by Exchange Tier

   - Minimum liquidity: $500,000 - $2,000,000
   - Daily volume requirement: $1,000,000+

2. Mid-Tier CEX
   - Minimum liquidity: $100,000 - $500,000

3. Small CEX
   - Minimum liquidity: $10,000 - $100,000
   - Daily volume requirement: $50,000+
   - No strict market making requirements

4. DEX (Uniswap, PancakeSwap)
   - Minimum recommended: $10,000+
   - No strict requirements
   - Self-managed liquidity
