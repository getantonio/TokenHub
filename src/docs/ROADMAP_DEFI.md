# DeFi Loan Factory Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development of a decentralized finance (DeFi) loan factory - a protocol that enables the creation and management of lending pools with customizable parameters. The factory pattern allows for scalable deployment of standardized lending pools across multiple assets and networks.

## Technical Architecture

### Factory Pattern Implementation
The loan factory will use the factory design pattern to deploy and manage standardized lending pools:

```solidity
// Core Factory Contract
contract LoanPoolFactory {
    // Registry of deployed pools
    mapping(address => address) public assetToPools;
    address[] public allPools;
    
    // Protocol configuration
    address public governance;
    address public priceOracle;
    
    // Create new lending pool for a specific asset
    function createLendingPool(
        address asset,
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        uint256 collateralFactor,
        uint256 reserveFactor
    ) external onlyGovernance returns (address) {
        // Check if pool already exists
        require(assetToPools[asset] == address(0), "Pool already exists");
        
        // Deploy new pool using minimal proxy pattern
        address pool = deployMinimalProxy(
            implementation,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                LendingPool.initialize.selector,
                asset,
                name,
                symbol,
                collateralFactor,
                reserveFactor,
                priceOracle
            )
        );
        
        // Register pool
        assetToPools[asset] = pool;
        allPools.push(pool);
        
        emit PoolCreated(asset, pool);
        return pool;
    }
}
```

### Core Components
1. **Factory Contract**: Deploys and manages lending pools
2. **Lending Pool**: Handles deposits, borrows, repayments for a specific asset
3. **Interest Rate Model**: Calculates borrow and supply rates based on utilization
4. **Price Oracle**: Provides asset price data for collateral valuation
5. **Risk Manager**: Monitors health factors and triggers liquidations
6. **Governance**: Controls protocol parameters and upgrades

### Proxy Pattern
The factory will use the minimal proxy pattern (EIP-1167) to deploy clones of implementation contracts, significantly reducing gas costs while maintaining standardized functionality across all deployed pools.

### Lending Pool Implementation
The core lending pool contract that handles deposits, borrows, and repayments:

```solidity
// Simplified Lending Pool Contract
contract LendingPool {
    address public asset;            // The underlying asset (e.g., USDC)
    address public aToken;           // Tokenized deposit receipt
    address public priceOracle;      // Price feed
    uint256 public collateralFactor; // Max borrow amount relative to collateral (e.g., 75%)
    uint256 public reserveFactor;    // Portion of interest retained by protocol (e.g., 10%)
    
    // User account data
    struct AccountData {
        uint256 deposited;     // Amount of asset deposited
        uint256 borrowed;      // Amount of asset borrowed
        bool isCollateral;     // Whether deposit is used as collateral
    }
    
    mapping(address => AccountData) public accounts;
    
    // Protocol data
    uint256 public totalDeposits;
    uint256 public totalBorrows;
    uint256 public totalReserves;
    
    // Interest rate model
    address public interestRateModel;
    
    // Supply asset to the pool
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        // Transfer asset from user to pool
        // Mint aTokens to user
        // Update user's account data
        // Update pool data
    }
    
    // Borrow asset from the pool
    function borrow(uint256 amount) external {
        // Check user has sufficient collateral
        // Calculate health factor
        // Transfer asset to user
        // Update user's account data
        // Update pool data
    }
    
    // Repay borrowed asset
    function repay(uint256 amount) external {
        // Transfer asset from user to pool
        // Update user's account data
        // Update pool data
    }
    
    // Withdraw deposited asset
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        // Check withdrawal doesn't compromise health factor
        // Transfer asset to user
        // Burn aTokens
        // Update user's account data
        // Update pool data
    }
    
    // Liquidate undercollateralized position
    function liquidate(address borrower, uint256 amount) external {
        // Check borrower is liquidatable (health factor < 1)
        // Apply liquidation discount
        // Transfer asset from liquidator to pool
        // Transfer collateral from pool to liquidator
        // Update accounts and pool data
    }
}
```

### Economic Models

#### Interest Rate Model
The protocol will use a dynamic interest rate model based on pool utilization:

```
Utilization Rate = Total Borrows / Total Deposits
```

Interest rates will follow a kinked curve:
- Below optimal utilization (e.g., 80%): Linear increase from base rate
- Above optimal utilization: Steep exponential increase to discourage 100% utilization

#### Liquidation Model
Positions become liquidatable when health factor falls below 1:

```
Health Factor = (Collateral Value * Collateral Factor) / Borrowed Value
```

Liquidators receive a discount (e.g., 5-10%) on collateral when repaying bad debt, incentivizing quick liquidations to maintain protocol solvency.
