# Creating Utility Tokens: Best Practices Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines best practices for creating utility tokens that serve a genuine purpose within your platform or ecosystem. The focus is on developing tokens with real utility value while ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Key Components

### 1. Defining Your Token's Utility

  - Development team allocation
  - Community treasury

#### Economic Model
- **Token Velocity**: How frequently will tokens change hands?
